Note for Gmail Users, you need to generate an app password instead of your normal email password. This also requires enabling 2-step authentication. Follow the instructions here to set-up 2-Step Factor Authentication as well as App Password Generation:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en/. Set-up 2 Factor Authentication, then create the App Password, choose Mail as the App and give it any name you want. This will output a 16 letter password for you. Pass in this password as your login password for the smtp.
